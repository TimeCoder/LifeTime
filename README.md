LifeTime - it is a model of the time travels based on Conway's Life algorythm.

You can:
- view simulation of 2D-world
- switch on virtual time machine and choose the object to move it in the timeline
- view the whole world history, choose the destination point in the past 
- send the object into the past and see the alternative events chains (new reality)
- view the graph of new reality deviation and its statistics

Whats is all about?
There are disputes about how the history may respond to attempts of its change. No more hypothesis, we can now check it!

Want to know more?
This and many other projects is a part of "Time Academy", an open community for a comprehensive study of the nature of time. Welcome!
